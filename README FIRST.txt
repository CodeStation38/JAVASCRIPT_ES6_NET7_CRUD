This is an example of the type of projects I worked with, related to JavaScript. 
I wrote these examples in my free time. These examples do not belong to the companies I worked for, so there are no data privacy or copyright issues. I recently reviewed this DEMO. Thank you.

Previous requirements:

DEFAULT BROWSER, GOOGLE CHROME.
Visual Studio 2022.
.NET CORE 7.

WHAT'S THIS APPLICATION ABOUT?

This is a simple fictional company Department's CRUD monolithic web application made with JavaScript (ES6). I considered important to analyze and study the latest technologies and good practices related to JavaScript. 


----------------------------------

HOW TO RUN IT LOCALLY?

1- Open the soluton located at:
    \\JAVASCRIPT CRUD\JSwebapiCRUD\JSwebapiCRUD.sln

2- Make sure have the option "http" selected in the set of boxes 
    Debug->Any CPU->http

3- Click on Solution Explorer.

4- Locate the file "index.html" inside the folder "wwwroot"

5- Right click on the file index.html 

6- Make sure to have selected the Browser Google Chrome in the 
   "View in Browser" option. If you wish to use another Browser, you can select it from the option "Browse with" below the "View in Browser" option.

7- Click on "View in Browser" option.

8- The Web API will start automatically and the "index.html" will be opened in a 
    new Google Chrome page. 

9- You can try CRUD operations now.

----------------------------------

Highlights:

ES6 introduces major improvements to JavaScript:

    - let and const: These new reserved words allow to write code free from the
      "hoisting" problem when the "var" reserved word is used incorrectly.
